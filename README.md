Convert obsidian type markdown to normal markdown
## Features

### Fix picture embeded ( not implements now )
In obsidian markdown, it is `![[path]]`. this tool replace this `![](path)`  
This is `<img />` in HTML.

### enabled new line
In obsidian app view, new line is enabled, but normal markdown ignore new line. So add "  ".
