# obsidian-md-normalize
Convert obsidian type markdown to normal markdown ***For me***
## Features

### Fix picture embeded  
In obsidian markdown, it is `![[path]]`. this tool replace this `![](path)`  
This is `<img />` in HTML.  
Target picture file extentions are ["jpeg", "jpg", "png", "gif", "bmp", "webp", "tiff", "apng"].  
You will be able to add some picture extentions. I don't implement now.  

### enabled new line  
In obsidian app view, new line is enabled, but normal markdown ignore new line. So add "  ".
